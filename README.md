# Amazon Recommendation Engine

This repository showcases the development of a recommendation system using Amazon's Electronics ratings dataset. The project employs collaborative filtering techniques powered by the `Surprise` library to suggest products to users based on their interaction history.

## Project Overview

Recommendation systems are integral to improving user experiences on e-commerce platforms. In this project, we use a subset of Amazon's Electronics dataset to build a collaborative filtering-based recommendation engine. This system predicts user ratings for unseen products and recommends the most relevant items.

## Dataset Details

The dataset, `ratings_Electronics.csv`, contains the following columns:

- **userId**: Unique identifier for each user.
- **productId**: Unique identifier for each product.
- **rating**: User rating for the product (on a scale of 1 to 5).
- **timestamp**: Time of the rating (in Unix time format).

This dataset is essential for collaborative filtering, which relies on user-item interactions to make recommendations.

## Key Features of the Project

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaning and filtering data to remove inconsistencies and sparsity.
   - Handling missing values and irrelevant features.

2. **Collaborative Filtering**:
   - Implemented using the `Surprise` library for building user and item-based filtering models.
   - Predicting ratings for unseen products and recommending the top items for each user.

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using **seaborn** and **matplotlib**.
   - Visualizing trends in user interactions and product popularity.
